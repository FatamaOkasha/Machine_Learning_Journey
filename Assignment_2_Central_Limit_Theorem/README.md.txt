# Assignment 2: Central Limit Theorem (CLT) and Sample Means

## Overview
This project demonstrates the Central Limit Theorem by:
- Generating sample means from a population
- Plotting histograms of sample means
- Overlaying the normal distribution to show the CLT

## Folder Structure
- `src/` - Python script (`clt_sample_means.py`)
- `results/` - saved plots
- `README.md` - project description
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
2. Run the script:
