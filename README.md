# Machine Learning Journey

This repository showcases my Machine Learning projects and assignments in my masters degree in AI,  It includes implementations of core ML concepts, data analysis, and visualization using Python.

## Projects

1. **Assignment 1: Outlier Analysis**
   - implementation of calculations of statistics from scratch (without using built-in functions like numpy.mean() or pandas.std()) before and after removing outliers.
   - Detects and classifies outliers in Data1.txt
   - Visualizations: histogram, boxplot, line plot before and after removal of outliers
   - Anaysis report of all results and its impact on dataset
2. **Assignment 2: Central limit theorem and sample means**
   - Demonstrates the Central Limit Theorem by generating sample means from a population dataset.
   - Visualizes histograms of sample means for different sample sizes (e.g., 5, 30, 100).
   - Overlays the normal distribution to show how sample means approximate a normal distribution as sample size increases.
   - Includes Python scripts and generated plots demonstrating the CLT concept in practice.
