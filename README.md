# Machine Learning Journey

This repository showcases my Machine Learning projects and assignments in my masters degree in Ai 

## Projects

1. **Assignment 1: Outlier Analysis**
   - implementation of calculations of statistics from scratch (without using built-in functions like numpy.mean() or pandas.std()) before and after removing outliers.
   - Detects and classifies outliers in Data1.txt
   - Visualizations: histogram, boxplot, line plot before and after removal of outliers
   - Anaysis report of all results and its impact on dataset
